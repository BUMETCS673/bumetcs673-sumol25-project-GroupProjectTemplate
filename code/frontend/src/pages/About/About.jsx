        <p>

        <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
        <p>
          Bedtime storytelling can be a challenge after a long day. Many parents run out of fresh ideas, and 
          screen time options often lack educational value. Our app bridges this gap by offering magical, 
          developmentally enriching stories at the tap of a button.

          We aim to make bedtime more meaningful. Our customizable stories promote language development, creativity, 
          emotional growth, and bonding — all through an easy-to-use, child-friendly interface.
